# Example Crossplane-managed GCP Route.
# This route sends traffic through a custom NAT VM instance.
#
# This file is OPTIONAL and NOT required for the local Kubernetes lab (kind).
# It is only relevant for users deploying on GCP with Crossplane.
#
# To use it:
# 1. Configure a Crossplane GCP provider named `gcp-provider-config`
# 2. Replace placeholders:
#      "<VPC_NETWORK_NAME>" → your VPC network name
#      "<GCP_PROJECT_ID>"   → your GCP project ID
#      "<GCP_ZONE>"         → zone where your NAT VM lives
#      "<NAT_VM_NAME>"      → name of the NAT instance (e.g. nat-vm)
# 3. Apply the manifest:
#      kubectl apply -f route-through-nat-example.yaml
