# rabbitmq-k8s-lab
RabbitMQ deployed on Kubernetes (operator + Helm chart)  
A secure default user setup (no anonymous, least-privileged user, etc.)  
Some example queues / exchanges / bindings / policies  
Prometheus alerts for RabbitMQ (queue size, CPU, memory, node down)  
A load generator (like perf-test) so people can actually trigger alerts
